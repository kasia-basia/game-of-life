# Game of Life

:seedling: :seedling: :seedling:

### This is a simple JavaScript app based on a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Conway in 1970. You can interact with the initial configuration and observe how it evolves.

Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
